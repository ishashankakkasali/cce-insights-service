# Release Notes

## Unreleased

### CCE 2.0.0 ClickHouse schema (breaking API changes)

Reads the 2.0.0 `cce_analytics` schema (Protocol / Matcher / Step SLA services replace the 1.x
Compliance Service). ClickHouse is rebuilt from PostgreSQL for 2.0.0 — no 1.x data compatibility.

- **Schema:** `compliance_event_logs` → `matcher_event_logs`; `step_instances.state` /
  `completion_status` → `step_status` (NOT_STARTED | COMPLETED) + `sla_status` ('' | OVERDUE |
  MISSED | MET); `completed_by_event_id` → `matched_event_id`; `overdue_date` / `missed_date` →
  `step_sla_state_transitions.process_by`; `protocol_instances.protocol_canonical` and
  `deviations.protocol_instance_id` dropped (rebuilt by joining `protocol_definitions` /
  `step_instances`); `mv_daily_compliance_kpis` step columns replaced. jOOQ classes regenerated.
- **`stepMetrics`** (`/protocols[/{id}]/compliance-summary`): removed `onTime`, `early`, `late`,
  `due`, `pending`; added `notStarted`, `slaMet`, `slaUnjudged`, `completedOnTime`, `completedLate`.
  `completed` no longer includes SKIPPED; `overdue` / `missed` are SLA verdicts that now include
  steps completed after the threshold.
- **Step analytics** (`/protocols/{id}/step-analytics`): `timelinessDistribution` is
  `{completedOnTime, completedLate}` (was `{early, onTime, late}`); removed `skippedCount`,
  `pendingCount`; added `notStartedCount`, `slaUnjudgedCount`; `overdueCount` / `missedCount` are SLA
  verdicts.
- **Patient compliance timeline:** journey rows and timeline events gain `stepStatus` + `slaStatus`
  and lose `completionStatus`; `status` / `state` values are now COMPLETED | OVERDUE | MISSED |
  NOT_STARTED (no PENDING / DUE / SKIPPED), and event `type` follows (`step_not_started`).
- **Protocol-tracking detail:** steps carry `stepStatus` + `slaStatus` instead of `state` +
  `completionStatus`; `overdueDate` / `missedDate` are the scheduled SLA thresholds.
- **Exports:** `overdue_steps` / `missed_steps` count SLA verdicts (include late completions).

## v1.1.0 — Demo Intelligence Release

**Release Date:** June 2025  
**Branch:** `demo-intelligence`  

---

### Overview

Major feature release adding intelligence analytics, protocol action introspection, dashboard endpoints, and practitioner ranking. Also includes significant data corrections for demo environment and expanded filtering across all analytics endpoints.

---

### New Features

- **Protocol Title & Related Artifacts** — `GET /patients/{id}/protocol-tracking` now returns `protocolTitle` (human-readable name) and `relatedArtifact` array (documentation URLs, thumbnail images) extracted from the protocol definition JSONB
- **Step Analytics Facility Filter** — `GET /protocols/{id}/step-analytics` now correctly filters by `facilityId`, using protocol-instance-level facility association so steps without individual facility-tagged events are still included
- **Dashboard Controller** — 2 new endpoints (`/dashboard/overview`, `/dashboard/compliance-summary`) providing aggregated KPI data
- **Practitioner Ranking Controller** — New endpoint for ranking practitioners by compliance rate, deviation count, or event volume
- **Protocol Action Order** — `GET /protocols/{id}/action-order` returns ordered list of protocol actions with `type` and `title` fields, enabling the UI to show only `fire-event` type intelligence actions
- **Intelligence Summary** — Respects date range and facility filters for dynamic analytics
- **All Protocols Compliance Summary** — `GET /protocols/compliance-summary` returns compliance summary across all protocols in one call
- **Due Date in Patient Timeline** — `PatientTimelineDto` now includes `dueDate` field for step tracking
- **Compliance Categorization** — Facilities and practitioners are categorized by compliance rate bands

---

### Improvements

- **Date range filters** — All analytics endpoints now accept `startDate` and `endDate` query parameters
- **Facility filter** — Protocol compliance summary endpoints respect `facilityId` filter
- **Intelligence delivery entities** — Added `IntelligenceDelivery`, `ReceiverAdaptor`, `DestinationAdaptorMapping` entities (9 total, up from 6)
- **14 controllers** (up from 11) with **37 GET endpoints** (revised from 38 after deduplication)
- **ActionOrderEntryDto** — Now includes `type` (from `action.type.coding[0].code`) and `title` (from `action.title`) fields extracted from the protocol definition JSONB

---

### Demo Data Corrections

- **Protocol relatedArtifact** — RMNCH protocol definition now includes `relatedArtifact` array with WHO guideline documentation link and thumbnail image
- **Practitioner roles** — Nurse/CHW assigned to non-consultation steps, Doctor only for consultation and referral-ack steps
- **Source attribution** — `event_log.source` and `step_instance.completed_by_source` set to `openMRS` for consultation events
- **Step renames** — "ANC Visit # Referral" → "ANC Visit # Referral Initiated", "ANC Visit # Referral Ack" → "ANC Visit # Referral Closure"
- **Fix scripts** — `04-fix-demo-data.sql` provides migration script for applying corrections to live databases

---

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed:** Step analytics (Service Workflow Compliance) showed inflated percentages (e.g., 1000%) when facility filter was active — step counts were unfiltered while denominator was facility-filtered
- **Fixed:** `AT_RISK` compliance category removed — only `COMPLIANT`, `MODERATE`, `NON_COMPLIANT` remain
- **Fixed:** Intelligence summary counted only last 30 days — now counts all deviations
- **Fixed:** Facility filter ignored on protocol compliance summary endpoints
- **Fixed:** Compliance rate formula now uses step-based calculation

---

---

### Bug Fixes in This Release

- **Fixed:** `FacilityRankingService.deviationCountMap` was never populated — compliance rate always returned 100%. Now queries deviation counts per facility.
- **Fixed:** `FacilityRankingService` compliance rate formula — changed from `1 - deviations/events` to step-based `(completedSteps + skippedSteps) / totalSteps`. Uses `findStepComplianceByFacility()` query.
- **Fixed:** `FacilityRankingService` rankBy switch-case — now matches UI values (`complianceRate`, `deviationCount`, `eventVolume`). Added `order` parameter (asc/desc) support.
- **Fixed:** `PatientRiskService.getAtRiskHotspots()` — was computing compliance categories globally instead of per-facility. Added `findFacilityPatientMapping()` query to scope patients per facility.
- **Fixed:** `ComplianceSummaryService.getFacilityComplianceSummary()` — was ignoring `facilityId` filter. Added `findPatientsByFacility()` query to restrict results to the requested facility.
- **Fixed:** `EventVolumeService.getTrends()` — source parameter was not being passed from controller to service. Wired the parameter through.
- **Fixed:** `EventVolumeService.getSummary()` — `processingStatusBreakdown` was always `null`. Now populates with `{matched: {count, percentage}, zeroMatch: {count, percentage}, duplicate: {count, percentage}}` using `countByProcessingStatus()` query.
- **Fixed:** Missing `logstash-logback-encoder` dependency — JSON logging (docker profile) would fail at runtime.
- **Fixed:** PostgreSQL nullable parameter CAST issue — native queries with nullable parameters now use `CAST(:param AS type)` across all 4 repository files.
- **Fixed:** `EventVolumeService.getSummary()` indexing bug — `countByFacility()` returns 3 columns but code indexed wrong column as count.
- **Fixed:** `java.time.Instant` casting — PostgreSQL returns `Instant` for `timestamptz` columns in native queries, not `Timestamp`. Added `DateUtil.toOffsetDateTime()` utility.
- **Fixed:** CSV export `HttpMessageNotWritableException` — `StreamingResponseBody` in `ResponseEntity` fails content negotiation. Rewritten to use `HttpServletResponse` directly.
- **Fixed:** `GlobalExceptionHandler` was silently swallowing exceptions — added `@Slf4j` and `log.error()` calls.

### Code Quality Improvements

- Extracted `DateUtil` utility — eliminated 4x duplicated `mapInterval()` and `extractDate()` methods across services.
- Added `DateUtil.toOffsetDateTime()` helper — handles `Instant`, `OffsetDateTime`, and `Timestamp` type conversion from native query results.
- Added `.dockerignore` for optimized Docker builds.
- Added `.env.example` for environment variable documentation.
- Implemented Caffeine caching with `@Cacheable` annotations on 25 service methods across 9 classes.

---

### Known Limitations

- **PatientController** accesses repositories directly — business logic should be delegated to services in a future refactor.
- **No pagination** on some list endpoints — cursor pagination to be added where missing.
- **Per-instance caching** — Caffeine caches are not shared across instances. Phase 2 will introduce Redis for distributed caching.
