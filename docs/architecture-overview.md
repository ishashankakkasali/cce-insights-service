# Architecture & Design

## 1. System Context

The **CCE Insights Service** (referred to as "Analytics Service" in the Solution Design v0.3) serves compliance analytics data — protocol adherence rates, deviation trends, facility-level summaries, patient compliance timelines, ingestion pipeline metrics, and source system quality analysis. It is a **read-only** service that queries the Compliance DB and Collector DB directly and exposes REST APIs consumed by the Analytics UI dashboard.

> All inbound requests arrive via the **CCE Gateway Service**, which validates OAuth tokens and enforces the `dashboard:read` scope. The Insights Service does not handle authentication or authorization.

**This service does NOT handle:** event ingestion, protocol matching, step completion, deviation detection, time-based transitions, authentication/authorization, or any write operations.

> **Event Volume Analytics:** In addition to compliance-focused analytics, the Insights Service provides event volume metrics — counts of clinical events grouped by FHIR `resourceType`, facility, practitioner, and source system. These metrics are derived from the `event_log` table (immutable log of all inbound CloudEvents maintained by the Compliance Service). Practitioner information is extracted from the `event_log.data` JSONB column using resource-type-specific paths.

> **Ingestion Analytics:** The Insights Service also queries the `inbound_event` table (owned by the Collector Service) to provide ingestion pipeline metrics — acceptance/rejection funnels, rejection reason analysis, source data quality scores, and pipeline loss tracking. Source comparison and source-level event counts are also powered by `inbound_event` to capture ALL received events, not just compliance-matched ones.

## 4. Data Access Patterns

### 4.1 Read-Only Design

All queries are read-only. The Insights Service never performs `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`. ClickHouse is an append-only analytics engine — mutations are rare and handled exclusively by the data pipeline, never by this service.

jOOQ generates type-safe Java field references from the live ClickHouse schema. The generated classes live in `src/generated/jooq/` and are committed to the repo. Repositories use `DSLContext` directly — no ORM, no entity manager, no `@Transactional`.

```java
// Example: type-safe field reference instead of raw string
dsl.select(DSL.field(STEP_INSTANCES.STATE.getName()))
   .from(DSL.table(DSL.sql("step_instances")))
   .where(DSL.field(STEP_INSTANCES.PATIENT_ID.getName()).eq(patientId))
   .fetch();
```

### 4.2 Tables Queried

| Table | Type | Queries Used For |
|---|---|---|
| `protocol_definitions` | ReplacingMergeTree | Protocol metadata (name, version, URL) |
| `protocol_instances` | ReplacingMergeTree | Patient enrollments, compliance rates, filtering |
| `step_instances` | ReplacingMergeTree | Step states, timing, completion, facility joins via `mv_patient_facility_latest` |
| `deviations` | ReplacingMergeTree | Deviation records, trends, counts by type |
| `compliance_event_logs` | MergeTree | Patient event history, timeline, event volume analytics |
| `inbound_event_logs` | MergeTree | Ingestion funnel, rejection analytics, source quality, pipeline loss |
| `intelligence_deliveries` | ReplacingMergeTree | Intelligence delivery tracking, action type stats, delivery status |
| `receiver_adaptor` | ReplacingMergeTree | Adaptor registry lookups |
| `destination_adaptor_mapping` | ReplacingMergeTree | Destination routing configuration |
| `mv_patient_facility_latest` | AggregatingMV | Latest facility per patient (used in step_instances joins) |
| `mv_practitioner_summary` | AggregatingMV | Pre-aggregated practitioner analytics |
| `mv_facility_summary` | AggregatingMV | Pre-aggregated facility summaries |

> **FINAL clause:** ClickHouse `ReplacingMergeTree` tables may have duplicate rows until background merges complete. The `FINAL` modifier forces deduplication at query time. It is disabled by default (`CLICKHOUSE_USE_FINAL=false`) for performance and can be enabled per environment.

### 4.3 Key Query Patterns

**Protocol Compliance Summary:**
```sql
SELECT
  pd.url || '|' || pd.version AS protocol_canonical,
  COUNT(DISTINCT pi.id) AS total_enrollments,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN pi.status = 'COMPLETED' THEN pi.id END) AS completed,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN pi.status = 'ACTIVE' THEN pi.id END) AS active,
  AVG(
    CASE WHEN pi.status IN ('ACTIVE', 'COMPLETED') THEN
      (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM step_instance si WHERE si.protocol_instance_id = pi.id AND si.state = 'COMPLETED')::float /
      NULLIF((SELECT COUNT(*) FROM step_instance si WHERE si.protocol_instance_id = pi.id), 0)
    END
  ) AS avg_compliance_rate
FROM protocol_instance pi
JOIN protocol_definition pd ON pi.protocol_definition_id = pd.id
WHERE pd.id = :protocolDefinitionId
GROUP BY pd.url, pd.version;
```

**Facility Compliance Summary:**
```sql
SELECT
  el.facility_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT pi.id) AS total_enrollments,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN si.state IN ('OVERDUE', 'MISSED') THEN pi.id END) AS with_deviations
FROM protocol_instance pi
JOIN step_instance si ON si.protocol_instance_id = pi.id
JOIN event_log el ON el.protocol_instance_id = pi.id
WHERE el.facility_id = :facilityId
  AND el.facility_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY el.facility_id;
```

**Event Volume by Resource Type:**
```sql
SELECT
  el.data->>'resourceType' AS resource_type,
  COUNT(*) AS event_count
FROM event_log el
WHERE el.processing_status != 'DUPLICATE'
  AND (:facilityId IS NULL OR el.facility_id = :facilityId)
  AND (:startDate IS NULL OR el.event_time >= :startDate)
  AND (:endDate IS NULL OR el.event_time <= :endDate)
GROUP BY el.data->>'resourceType'
ORDER BY event_count DESC;
```

**Event Volume by Facility:**
```sql
SELECT
  el.facility_id,
  el.data->>'resourceType' AS resource_type,
  COUNT(*) AS event_count
FROM event_log el
WHERE el.facility_id IS NOT NULL
  AND el.processing_status != 'DUPLICATE'
  AND (:startDate IS NULL OR el.event_time >= :startDate)
  AND (:endDate IS NULL OR el.event_time <= :endDate)
GROUP BY el.facility_id, el.data->>'resourceType'
ORDER BY el.facility_id, event_count DESC;
```

**Event Volume by Practitioner:**

Practitioner references are extracted from different JSONB paths depending on the FHIR resource type:

| Resource Type | JSONB Path | Example Value |
|---|---|---|
| Encounter | `data->'participant'->0->'individual'->'reference'` | `Practitioner/HLC-PRAC-2025-00005` |
| Observation | `data->'performer'->0->'reference'` | `Practitioner/HLC-PRAC-2025-00005` |
| Condition | `data->'asserter'->'reference'` | `Practitioner/f830114a-...` |
| MedicationRequest | `data->'requester'->'reference'` | `Practitioner/f830114a-...` |
| MedicationDispense | `data->'performer'->0->'actor'->'reference'` | `Practitioner/...` |
| MedicationAdministration | `data->'performer'->0->'actor'->'reference'` | `Practitioner/...` |
| ServiceRequest | `data->'requester'->'reference'` | `Practitioner/...` |
| Procedure | `data->'performer'->0->'actor'->'reference'` | `Practitioner/...` |
| Immunization | `data->'performer'->0->'actor'->'reference'` | `Practitioner/...` |

```sql
SELECT
  COALESCE(
    el.data->'participant'->0->'individual'->>'reference',
    el.data->'performer'->0->>'reference',
    el.data->'asserter'->>'reference',
    el.data->'requester'->>'reference',
    el.data->'performer'->0->'actor'->>'reference'
  ) AS practitioner_ref,
  el.data->>'resourceType' AS resource_type,
  COUNT(*) AS event_count
FROM event_log el
WHERE el.processing_status != 'DUPLICATE'
  AND (:facilityId IS NULL OR el.facility_id = :facilityId)
  AND (:startDate IS NULL OR el.event_time >= :startDate)
  AND (:endDate IS NULL OR el.event_time <= :endDate)
GROUP BY practitioner_ref, resource_type
HAVING practitioner_ref IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY event_count DESC;
```

**Event Volume by Source System:**
```sql
SELECT
  el.source,
  el.data->>'resourceType' AS resource_type,
  COUNT(*) AS event_count
FROM event_log el
WHERE el.processing_status != 'DUPLICATE'
  AND (:startDate IS NULL OR el.event_time >= :startDate)
  AND (:endDate IS NULL OR el.event_time <= :endDate)
GROUP BY el.source, el.data->>'resourceType'
ORDER BY el.source, event_count DESC;
```

**Deviation Trends:**
```sql
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC(:interval, d.detected_at) AS period,
  d.deviation_type,
  COUNT(*) AS count
FROM deviation d
WHERE d.detected_at BETWEEN :startDate AND :endDate
GROUP BY period, d.deviation_type
ORDER BY period;
```

---

## 5. Caching

The Insights Service uses **Caffeine** for in-memory response caching, organized into three tiers with configurable TTLs:

| Cache Name | Default TTL | Max Entries | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lookups` | 60 minutes | 50 | Dropdown filter data (protocols, facilities, practitioners, sources, patients) |
| `analytics` | 30 minutes | 200 | Compliance summaries, protocol analytics, deviation analytics, patient risk |
| `metrics` | 15 minutes | 500 | Event volume, ingestion pipeline, processing quality |

**Configuration:** TTLs are configurable via environment variables `CACHE_TTL_LOOKUPS`, `CACHE_TTL_ANALYTICS`, `CACHE_TTL_METRICS` (in minutes).

**Cache annotations:** `@Cacheable` is applied to 25 service methods across 9 service classes. Cache keys are derived from method parameters (date ranges, filters, IDs).

### Phased Architecture

| Phase | Data Source | Caching | Trade-off |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1 (current)** | Compliance DB `cce_collector` (direct queries) | Caffeine (in-memory, 3-tier) | Simple deployment; good for low-to-moderate scale |
| **Phase 2 (future)** | Dedicated analytics DB (materialized views or CDC) | Redis (distributed) | Query performance at scale; eventual consistency |

Phase 2 transition will be transparent to API consumers — same endpoints, same response schemas.

## 6. Error Handling

| Scenario | Response | HTTP Status |
|---|---|---|
| Resource not found | `{ "error": { "code": "NOT_FOUND", "message": "..." } }` | 404 |
| Invalid query parameters | `{ "error": { "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR", "message": "..." } }` | 400 |
| Database unreachable | `{ "error": { "code": "SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE", "message": "..." } }` | 503 |
| Unexpected error | `{ "error": { "code": "INTERNAL_ERROR", "message": "..." } }` | 500 |

---

## 7. Observability

### Metrics

| Metric | Type | Tags | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cce.insights.request.duration` | Timer | `endpoint`, `status` | REST endpoint response time |
| `cce.insights.query.duration` | Timer | `query_type` | Database query execution time |
| `cce.insights.request.count` | Counter | `endpoint`, `status` | Request count per endpoint |

### Health Indicators

| Indicator | Details |
|---|---|
| `db` (auto) | PostgreSQL connectivity |
| `diskSpace` (auto) | Disk space availability |

---

## 8. Scaling & Deployment

- **Stateless:** No local state, no Kafka consumer groups — can be scaled horizontally without coordination.
- **Deployment:** 2+ instances behind a load balancer for high availability.
- **Database connection pool:** Size per instance should account for total instances × pool size ≤ PostgreSQL `max_connections` allocation for analytics.
- **Read replicas (future):** Phase 2 can point the Insights Service at a PostgreSQL read replica to eliminate any impact on the Compliance Service's write performance.

---

## 9. Additional Query Patterns

These are the SQL patterns for the protocol analytics, deviation analytics, facility ranking, event processing quality, and patient risk endpoints.

**Step Analytics (Timeliness Distribution):**
```sql
SELECT
  si.action_id,
  COUNT(*) AS total_instances,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN si.state = 'COMPLETED' THEN 1 END) AS completed_count,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN si.completion_status = 'EARLY' THEN 1 END) AS early_count,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN si.completion_status = 'ON_TIME' THEN 1 END) AS on_time_count,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN si.completion_status = 'LATE' THEN 1 END) AS late_count,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN si.state = 'OVERDUE' THEN 1 END) AS overdue_count,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN si.state = 'MISSED' THEN 1 END) AS missed_count,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN si.state = 'SKIPPED' THEN 1 END) AS skipped_count,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (si.completed_at - si.due_date)) / 86400.0)
    FILTER (WHERE si.state = 'COMPLETED' AND si.due_date IS NOT NULL) AS avg_days_to_complete,
  PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (si.completed_at - si.due_date)) / 86400.0)
    FILTER (WHERE si.state = 'COMPLETED' AND si.due_date IS NOT NULL) AS median_days_to_complete
FROM step_instance si
JOIN protocol_instance pi ON si.protocol_instance_id = pi.id
WHERE pi.protocol_definition_id = :protocolDefinitionId
GROUP BY si.action_id;
```

**Completion Funnel:**
```sql
SELECT
  si.action_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT pi.patient_id) AS reached_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN si.state = 'COMPLETED' THEN pi.patient_id END) AS completed_count
FROM step_instance si
JOIN protocol_instance pi ON si.protocol_instance_id = pi.id
WHERE pi.protocol_definition_id = :protocolDefinitionId
GROUP BY si.action_id;
```

**Protocol Outcome Distribution:**
```sql
SELECT
  pi.status,
  COUNT(*) AS count
FROM protocol_instance pi
WHERE pi.protocol_definition_id = :protocolDefinitionId
GROUP BY pi.status;
```

**Enrollment Trends:**
```sql
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC(:interval, pi.enrolled_at) AS period,
  COUNT(*) AS enrollments
FROM protocol_instance pi
WHERE pi.protocol_definition_id = :protocolDefinitionId
  AND pi.enrolled_at BETWEEN :startDate AND :endDate
GROUP BY period
ORDER BY period;
```

**Facility Ranking (by compliance rate):**
```sql
SELECT
  el.facility_id,
  COUNT(DISTINCT pi.id) AS total_enrollments,
  AVG(
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM step_instance si2
     WHERE si2.protocol_instance_id = pi.id AND si2.state IN ('COMPLETED', 'SKIPPED'))::float /
    NULLIF((SELECT COUNT(*) FROM step_instance si3 WHERE si3.protocol_instance_id = pi.id), 0)
  ) AS compliance_rate,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM deviation d
   JOIN protocol_instance pi2 ON d.protocol_instance_id = pi2.id
   JOIN event_log el2 ON el2.protocol_instance_id = pi2.id
   WHERE el2.facility_id = el.facility_id
     AND d.detected_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days') AS active_deviations,
  COUNT(DISTINCT el.id) AS total_events
FROM protocol_instance pi
JOIN event_log el ON el.protocol_instance_id = pi.id
WHERE el.facility_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY el.facility_id
ORDER BY compliance_rate DESC;
```

**Deviations by Action:**
```sql
SELECT
  si.action_id,
  pi.protocol_definition_id,
  pi.protocol_canonical,
  COUNT(*) AS total_deviations,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN d.deviation_type = 'OVERDUE' THEN 1 END) AS overdue_count,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN d.deviation_type = 'MISSED' THEN 1 END) AS missed_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT pi.patient_id) AS affected_patients
FROM deviation d
JOIN step_instance si ON d.step_instance_id = si.id
JOIN protocol_instance pi ON d.protocol_instance_id = pi.id
GROUP BY si.action_id, pi.protocol_definition_id, pi.protocol_canonical
ORDER BY total_deviations DESC;
```

**Deviation Resolution Rate:**
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE si.state = 'COMPLETED') AS resolved_count,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE si.state = 'MISSED') AS escalated_count,
  COUNT(*) AS total_overdue,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (si.completed_at - d.detected_at)) / 86400.0)
    FILTER (WHERE si.state = 'COMPLETED') AS avg_days_to_resolve
FROM deviation d
JOIN step_instance si ON d.step_instance_id = si.id
WHERE d.deviation_type = 'OVERDUE';
```

**Event Processing Quality:**
```sql
SELECT
  el.source,
  el.processing_status,
  COUNT(*) AS count
FROM event_log el
WHERE el.event_time BETWEEN :startDate AND :endDate
GROUP BY el.source, el.processing_status
ORDER BY el.source;
```

**At-Risk Patient Hotspots** (`StepInstanceRepository#findAtRiskHotspotCounts()`, backing `PatientRiskService#getAtRiskHotspots()`):

A two-level aggregation done entirely in ClickHouse — per-patient risk flags first, then rolled up per facility:

```sql
SELECT
  per_patient.facility_id,
  countIf(per_patient.has_missed = 1) AS non_compliant,
  countIf(per_patient.has_missed = 0 AND per_patient.has_overdue = 1) AS at_risk,
  countIf(per_patient.has_missed = 0 AND per_patient.has_overdue = 0) AS on_track
FROM (
  SELECT
    pf.facility_id AS facility_id,
    pi.patient_id AS patient_id,
    maxIf(1, si.state = 'MISSED') AS has_missed,
    maxIf(1, si.state = 'OVERDUE') AS has_overdue
  FROM step_instances si
  JOIN protocol_instances pi ON si.protocol_instance_id = pi.id
  JOIN mv_patient_facility_latest pf ON pf.patient_id = pi.patient_id
  WHERE pf.facility_id != ''
  GROUP BY pf.facility_id, pi.patient_id
) AS per_patient
GROUP BY per_patient.facility_id;
```

**Why the two-level shape:** an earlier version loaded every `protocol_instance` into Java (`ProtocolInstanceRepository.findAll()`, unfiltered — no facility/date scoping existed to filter by), then queried `step_instances WHERE protocol_instance_id IN (id1, id2, ...)` with one bind parameter per instance. That worked while the instance count was small, but once dev accumulated enough protocol instances the generated `IN (...)` clause got large enough that ClickHouse's HTTP transport rejected the request outright (`Code: 62, transport error: 400`) — surfaced to the frontend as a generic `503 Service unavailable — database may be down` via the `DataAccessException` handler, with the real cause invisible unless you read the service's own logs. The fix pushes the categorization into ClickHouse as a single query, so cost scales with data volume server-side instead of with instance count in a Java-constructed `IN` clause.

Neither the old nor the current version applies `protocolDefinitionId`/`startDate`/`endDate`/pagination — the controller and service both accept these params, but the service ignores all of them and always returns a system-wide, unpaginated result. This predates the query-shape fix and is a separate, still-open gap (see [api-reference.md §12.1](api-reference.md#121-get-v1insightspatientsat-risk-hotspots)).

**Repeat Deviation Patients:**
```sql
SELECT
  pi.patient_id,
  COUNT(*) AS total_deviations,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN d.deviation_type = 'OVERDUE' THEN 1 END) AS overdue_count,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN d.deviation_type = 'MISSED' THEN 1 END) AS missed_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT pi.id) AS affected_protocols,
  COUNT(DISTINCT d.step_instance_id) AS affected_steps
FROM deviation d
JOIN protocol_instance pi ON d.protocol_instance_id = pi.id
GROUP BY pi.patient_id
HAVING COUNT(*) >= :minDeviations
ORDER BY total_deviations DESC;
```

**Consent Funnel Metrics** (`StepInstanceRepository#aggregateConsentMetrics()`, backing the Dashboard's `consent` block — see [api-reference.md §15.2](api-reference.md#152-get-v1insightsdashboardcompliance-summary)):

Tiberbu-specific (Kenya SHA outpatient protocol). A single-row aggregate over `step_instances`, no join:

```sql
SELECT
  countIf(action_id = 'consent-request'      AND state = 'COMPLETED') AS total_received,
  countIf(action_id = 'consent-verification' AND state = 'COMPLETED') AS total_verified
FROM step_instances;
```

System-wide, not scoped to a protocol — any protocol reusing these exact `action_id`s would be counted too. `verificationRate = totalVerified / totalReceived * 100` (in `DashboardService`), `0` when `totalReceived` is `0`.

---

## 10. Ingestion Analytics Query Patterns

These queries use the `inbound_event` table (Collector Service) for ingestion pipeline visibility.

**Ingestion Funnel (by status):**
```sql
SELECT ie.status, COUNT(*) FROM inbound_event ie
WHERE (:facilityId IS NULL OR ie.facility_id = :facilityId)
  AND (:source IS NULL OR ie.source = :source)
  AND (:startDate IS NULL OR ie.received_at >= :startDate)
  AND (:endDate IS NULL OR ie.received_at <= :endDate)
GROUP BY ie.status ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```

**Rejection Analytics (by reason):**
```sql
SELECT ie.rejection_reason, COUNT(*) FROM inbound_event ie
WHERE ie.status = 'REJECTED'
  AND (:facilityId IS NULL OR ie.facility_id = :facilityId)
GROUP BY ie.rejection_reason ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
```

**Source Data Quality:**
```sql
SELECT ie.source, ie.status, COUNT(*) FROM inbound_event ie
WHERE (:facilityId IS NULL OR ie.facility_id = :facilityId)
GROUP BY ie.source, ie.status ORDER BY ie.source, COUNT(*) DESC;
```

**Pipeline Loss (accepted vs compliance-matched):**
```sql
SELECT ie.source, COUNT(*) AS accepted FROM inbound_event ie WHERE ie.status = 'ACCEPTED'
GROUP BY ie.source;

SELECT el.source, COUNT(*) AS matched FROM event_log el WHERE el.processing_status = 'MATCHED'
GROUP BY el.source;
```

**Source Comparison (overlapping events):**
```sql
SELECT a.subject, COUNT(*) FROM inbound_event a
JOIN inbound_event b ON a.subject = b.subject
  AND a.type = b.type
  AND ABS(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (a.event_time - b.event_time))) <= :windowSeconds
WHERE a.source = :sourceA AND b.source = :sourceB
GROUP BY a.subject;
```
