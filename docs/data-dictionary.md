# CCE Insights Service — Data Dictionary

Comprehensive reference for all database tables queried, DTOs, query parameters, aggregation formulas, and metrics used by the Insights Service.

> The Insights Service does **not own** any database tables. All tables are owned by the Protocol Service, Matcher Service and Step SLA Service (the 1.x Compliance Service was split into these three in 2.0.0), the Intelligence Service, or the Collector Service. The service reads their ClickHouse copies in `cce_analytics` (Debezium CDC from PostgreSQL `ccedb`; DDL in `cce-data-pipeline/schema`), where table names are plural (`step_instances`, `deviations`, `matcher_event_logs`, …). This data dictionary documents the read-only view used by the Insights Service.

---

## 1. Database Tables (Read-Only)

### 1.1 `protocol_definition`

Protocol definition metadata. Queried for display names and protocol versioning.

| Column | Type | Used By Insights | Purpose |
|--------|------|------------------|----------|
| `id` | `UUID` | Yes | PK — join target for protocol-level APIs |
| `url` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | Protocol canonical URL |
| `version` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | Protocol version |
| `status` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | Filter active vs retired protocols |
| `definition` | `JSONB` | Yes | Full FHIR R4 PlanDefinition — protocol name from `definition->'name'`, title from `definition->'title'`, action order from `definition->'action'` array (type from `action.type.coding[0].code`, title from `action.title`), `relatedArtifact` array with documentation URLs and thumbnail image references |
| `loaded_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | Yes | When protocol was loaded |

### 1.2 `protocol_instance`

Patient enrollments in protocols. Primary table for compliance aggregation.

| Column | Type | Used By Insights | Purpose |
|--------|------|------------------|---------|
| `id` | `UUID` | Yes | PK |
| `protocol_definition_id` | `UUID` | Yes | FK → `protocol_definition.id` |
| `patient_id` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | Patient UPID — group-by key |
| `status` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | `ACTIVE`, `COMPLETED`, `WITHDRAWN`, `EXPIRED` |
| `enrolled_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | Yes | Enrollment timestamp |
| `created_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | Yes | Record creation |
| `updated_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | Yes | Last status change |

> **2.0.0:** `protocol_canonical` was dropped. The API's `protocolCanonical` (`url|version`) is rebuilt by joining `protocol_definitions` on `protocol_definition_id` (`AbstractClickHouseRepository.protocolInstancesWithCanonical`).

> **Note:** `protocol_instance` does not have a `facility_id` column. Facility-based filtering is achieved by joining through `event_log.facility_id` (using `event_log.protocol_instance_id`).

### 1.3 `step_instance`

Individual protocol steps per patient. Primary table for compliance calculations.
2.0.0 split the 1.x `state` column into two independent statuses written by two services:
`step_status` (Matcher — did the expected event arrive?) and `sla_status` (Step SLA — was the deadline met?).

| Column | Type | Used By Insights | Purpose |
|--------|------|------------------|---------|
| `id` | `UUID` | Yes | PK |
| `protocol_instance_id` | `UUID` | Yes | FK → `protocol_instance.id` |
| `action_id` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | PlanDefinition action ID |
| `repeat_index` | `INTEGER` | Yes | Recurrence index |
| `step_status` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | `NOT_STARTED`, `COMPLETED` |
| `sla_status` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | `OVERDUE`, `MISSED`, `MET`; NULL in PostgreSQL = not yet judged, which lands in ClickHouse as `''` (also the permanent value for optional steps) |
| `due_date` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | Yes | When step becomes due |
| `completed_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | Yes | Completion timestamp (clinical time of the completing event) |
| `completed_by_source` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | Source system that completed |
| `matched_event_id` | `UUID` | Yes | FK → `matcher_event_log.id` (1.x `completed_by_event_id`) |
| `required_behavior` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | FHIR `requiredBehavior`: `must`, `could`, `must-unless-documented` |

> **Removed in 2.0.0:** `state`, `completion_status`, `overdue_date`, `missed_date`. The overdue / missed
> thresholds now live in `step_sla_state_transition` (§1.3a). `MET` is only reached by a completion that
> beat the due date, so `OVERDUE` / `MISSED` can sit on a completed (late) step as well as an outstanding one.

### 1.3a `step_sla_state_transition` (new in 2.0.0)

Each mandatory step's SLA schedule — one row per verdict the Step SLA Service is to reach (Matcher
inserts, Step SLA marks processed).

| Column | Type | Used By Insights | Purpose |
|--------|------|------------------|---------|
| `id` | `UUID` | No | PK |
| `step_instance_id` | `UUID` | Yes | FK → `step_instance.id` |
| `transition_type` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | `DUE_DATE_REACHED` (→ OVERDUE on a breach), `MISSED_DATE_REACHED` (→ MISSED), `MET_CONDITION_REACHED` (→ MET) |
| `process_by` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | Yes | The threshold itself (clinical time): the due date, due date + tolerance-days, or the beating `completed_at` |
| `is_processed`, `processed_at`, `processed_by`, `attempts`, `next_attempt_at` | — | No | Step SLA work-queue bookkeeping |

Insights reads `process_by` of `DUE_DATE_REACHED` / `MISSED_DATE_REACHED` as the clinical occurrence
date of OVERDUE / MISSED deviations (§3.1a) and as `overdueDate` / `missedDate` in the protocol-tracking
detail (1.x `step_instance.overdue_date` / `missed_date`).

### 1.4 `deviation`

Recorded deviations from protocol pathways.

| Column | Type | Used By Insights | Purpose |
|--------|------|------------------|---------|
| `id` | `UUID` | Yes | PK |
| `step_instance_id` | `UUID` | Yes | FK → `step_instance.id` — also the only way to the enrollment (`step_instance.protocol_instance_id`) since 2.0.0 dropped `deviation.protocol_instance_id` |
| `deviation_type` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | `OVERDUE`, `MISSED` (Step SLA Service) or `ORDER_VIOLATION` (Matcher) — at most one row per (step, type) |
| `detected_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | Yes | When deviation was detected |
| `metadata` | `JSONB` | Yes | Additional context (due date, overdue date) |

### 1.5 `event_log`

Inbound clinical event audit trail. Queried for patient timeline views and **event volume analytics**.

| Column | Type | Used By Insights | Purpose |

| `action_id` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | Matched PlanDefinition action ID |
| `matched_step_instance_id` | `UUID` | Yes | Step completed by this event |

### 1.6 `inbound_event`

## 2. Enum Values

### 2.1 `ProtocolInstanceStatus`

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ACTIVE` | Protocol enrollment is ongoing |
| `COMPLETED` | All steps completed |
| `WITHDRAWN` | Enrollment cancelled |
| `EXPIRED` | Protocol expired without completion |

### 2.2 `StepStatus` (`step_instance.step_status`, Matcher Service)

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `NOT_STARTED` | The expected event has not arrived |
| `COMPLETED` | Completed by a matched event (terminal) |

### 2.3 `SlaStatus` (`step_instance.sla_status`, Step SLA Service)

| Value | Description | At-risk hotspot category (outstanding steps only) |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| *(null / `''`)* | Not yet judged — no threshold reached yet, or an optional step | on_track |
| `OVERDUE` | Due date passed before completion | at_risk |
| `MISSED` | Due date + tolerance passed before completion (written off) | non_compliant |
| `MET` | Completed on or before the due date | on_track |

**1.x → 2.0.0 mapping** (`StepState` and `CompletionStatus` were removed):

| 1.x | 2.0.0 `step_status` + `sla_status` |
|-----|-----------------------------------|
| `PENDING`, `DUE` | `NOT_STARTED` + not judged (the two are no longer distinguishable) |
| `OVERDUE` (not done) | `NOT_STARTED` + `OVERDUE` |
| `MISSED` | `NOT_STARTED` + `MISSED` |
| `COMPLETED` + `EARLY` / `ON_TIME` | `COMPLETED` + `MET` |
| `COMPLETED` + `LATE` | `COMPLETED` + `OVERDUE` (late) or `MISSED` (after write-off) |
| `SKIPPED` | — (no longer exists) |

The patient views show one badge per step, `StepInstance.displayStatus()`: `COMPLETED`, else the
outstanding step's `OVERDUE` / `MISSED`, else `NOT_STARTED`.

### 2.4 `DeviationType`

| Value | Description | Severity Mapping |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| `OVERDUE` | Step became overdue | Warning |

| `MODERATE` | One or more overdue steps (not yet missed) |
| `NON_COMPLIANT` | One or more missed steps |

| `ACCEPTED` | Validation passed, event published to Kafka |
| `REJECTED` | Validation or Kafka publish failed — see `rejection_reason` |
| `DUPLICATE` | Event already seen (same `cloudevents_id` + `source`) |

---

## 3. Aggregation Formulas

### 3.1 Compliance Rate

```
compliance_rate = completed_steps / total_steps
```

Where `completed_steps` counts `step_status = 'COMPLETED'` (whatever the `sla_status`; 1.x also counted `SKIPPED`, which no longer exists). `total_steps` counts all step instances for the protocol instance.

### 3.1a Deviation Occurrence Date

Deviation metrics are bucketed on when the deviation clinically **happened**, not `detected_at`:

```
occurred_at = coalesce(
    multiIf(deviation_type = 'OVERDUE',         DUE_DATE_REACHED.process_by,
            deviation_type = 'MISSED',          MISSED_DATE_REACHED.process_by,
            deviation_type = 'ORDER_VIOLATION', step_instance.completed_at),
    step_instance.due_date,
    deviation.detected_at)
```

The thresholds come from `step_sla_state_transition` (1.x read `step_instance.overdue_date` /
`missed_date`). Same resolution as the pipeline's `mv_daily_deviation_kpis`.

### 3.2 Deviation Severity Mapping

| Deviation Type | Severity |
|---|---|
| `OVERDUE` | `warning` |
| `MISSED` | `critical` |

### 3.3 Practitioner Reference Extraction (JSONB)

Practitioner references are embedded within the `event_log.data` JSONB column at resource-type-specific paths. The Insights Service uses `COALESCE` across multiple JSONB paths to extract the practitioner reference regardless of resource type.

| Resource Type | Reference Path | Display Path |
|---|---|---|
| `Encounter` | `data->'participant'->0->'individual'->>'reference'` | `data->'participant'->0->'individual'->>'display'` |
| `Observation` | `data->'performer'->0->>'reference'` | `data->'performer'->0->>'display'` |
| `Condition` | `data->'asserter'->>'reference'` | `data->'asserter'->>'display'` |
| `MedicationRequest` | `data->'requester'->>'reference'` | `data->'requester'->>'display'` |
| `MedicationDispense` | `data->'performer'->0->'actor'->>'reference'` | `data->'performer'->0->'actor'->>'display'` |
| `MedicationAdministration` | `data->'performer'->0->'actor'->>'reference'` | `data->'performer'->0->'actor'->>'display'` |
| `ServiceRequest` | `data->'requester'->>'reference'` | `data->'requester'->>'display'` |
| `Procedure` | `data->'performer'->0->'actor'->>'reference'` | `data->'performer'->0->'actor'->>'display'` |
| `Immunization` | `data->'performer'->0->'actor'->>'reference'` | `data->'performer'->0->'actor'->>'display'` |

**Unified extraction expression:**
```sql
COALESCE(
  data->'participant'->0->'individual'->>'reference',   -- Encounter
  data->'performer'->0->>'reference',                    -- Observation
  data->'asserter'->>'reference',                        -- Condition
  data->'requester'->>'reference',                       -- MedicationRequest, ServiceRequest
  data->'performer'->0->'actor'->>'reference'            -- MedicationDispense, Procedure, Immunization
) AS practitioner_ref
```

> **Note:** If a source system does not include practitioner references in event payloads, those events will have `NULL` practitioner_ref and will be excluded from practitioner-grouped metrics. The `display` field is best-effort — availability depends on source system behavior.

### 3.4 Event Volume Formulas

```
event_count_by_resource_type = COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE processing_status != 'DUPLICATE' GROUP BY data->>'resourceType'

event_percentage = (resource_type_count / total_non_duplicate_events) * 100

processing_status_breakdown (in events/summary):
  For each status in [MATCHED, ZERO_MATCH, DUPLICATE]:
    count = COUNT(processing_status = status)
    percentage = ROUND(count / total_events * 100, 1)
  Returns: { matched: {count, percentage}, zeroMatch: {count, percentage}, duplicate: {count, percentage} }
```

### 3.5 Step Analytics Formulas

```
completion_rate = completed_count / total_instances          -- completed = step_status 'COMPLETED'

-- per action, distinct patients:
completed_on_time = step_status 'COMPLETED' AND sla_status 'MET'
completed_late    = step_status 'COMPLETED' AND sla_status IN ('OVERDUE','MISSED')
overdue / missed  = sla_status 'OVERDUE' / 'MISSED'         -- includes steps completed late
not_started       = step_status 'NOT_STARTED'
sla_unjudged      = sla_status ''

avg_days_to_complete = AVG(completed_at - due_date) in days  -- only for COMPLETED steps with a due_date

median_days_to_complete = PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY (completed_at - due_date))
    -- only for COMPLETED steps with a due_date
```

### 3.6 Completion Funnel Formulas

```
reached_count = COUNT(DISTINCT patient_id) with a step_instance for this action_id (any status)

completed_count = COUNT(DISTINCT patient_id) with step_status = 'COMPLETED' for this action_id

completion_rate = completed_count / reached_count

drop_off_rate = 1 - completion_rate
```

> **Step ordering:** `stepOrder` is derived from the `PlanDefinition.action[]` array ordering and `relatedAction` dependencies defined in the protocol definition. The first step is enrollment itself.

### 3.7 Outcome Distribution Formulas

```
percentage = (status_count / total_instances) * 100
```

Where `status` is one of `ACTIVE`, `COMPLETED`, `WITHDRAWN`, `EXPIRED` from `protocol_instance.status`.

### 3.8 Enrollment Trend Formulas

```
enrollments = COUNT(*) FROM protocol_instance
    WHERE protocol_definition_id = :id
    GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC(:interval, enrolled_at)
```

Supported intervals: `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`.

### 3.9 Facility Ranking Formulas

```
compliance_rate = (completed_steps + skipped_steps) / total_steps per facility

active_deviations = COUNT(deviations) detected within last 30 days at facility

total_events = COUNT(DISTINCT event_log.id) at facility
```

Facility-level compliance is computed from `step_instance` aggregations (not per-protocol-instance averages). The `findStepComplianceByFacility()` query groups by `facility_id` and returns `totalSteps` and `completedSteps` (`step_status = COMPLETED`; 2.0.0 has no SKIPPED).

Ranking options (`rankBy` parameter):
| Value | Sort Expression |
|---|---|
| `complianceRate` | `compliance_rate` DESC (best first) or ASC (worst first) |
| `deviationCount` | `active_deviations` ASC (best first) or DESC (worst first) |
| `eventVolume` | `total_events` DESC or ASC |

### 3.10 Deviation By-Action Formulas

```
total_deviations = COUNT(*) FROM deviation WHERE step_instance.action_id = :actionId

overdue_count = COUNT(*) WHERE deviation_type = 'OVERDUE'
missed_count  = COUNT(*) WHERE deviation_type = 'MISSED'

affected_patients = COUNT(DISTINCT protocol_instance.patient_id)
```

### 3.11 Deviation Resolution Rate Formulas

Resolution is determined by tracking the current status of step instances that had an `OVERDUE` deviation:

```
resolved  = step_instance.step_status is 'COMPLETED' (completed after all, whatever the sla_status)
escalated = step_instance.step_status is 'NOT_STARTED' AND sla_status is 'MISSED' (written off)

resolution_rate = resolved_count / total_overdue_deviations

avg_days_to_resolve = AVG(step_instance.completed_at - deviation.detected_at) in days
    -- only for resolved (COMPLETED) overdue steps
```

### 3.12 Processing Quality Formulas

```
matched_rate   = COUNT(processing_status = 'MATCHED')   / total_events * 100
zero_match_rate = COUNT(processing_status = 'ZERO_MATCH') / total_events * 100
duplicate_rate  = COUNT(processing_status = 'DUPLICATE')  / total_events * 100
```

Breakdowns are computed per `source` system. A high `ZERO_MATCH` rate indicates misconfigured emitters or protocols that don't cover incoming event types.

### 3.13 At-Risk Hotspot Formulas

Patient compliance category is computed across **all active protocol instances** at a facility:

```
on_track       = patient has NO step_instance with state IN ('OVERDUE', 'MISSED') across all active enrollments
at_risk        = patient has at least one 'OVERDUE' step_instance AND NO 'MISSED'
non_compliant  = patient has at least one 'MISSED' step_instance

percentage = category_count / total_patients_at_facility * 100
```

> **Note:** Facility is derived by joining `protocol_instance` → `event_log.facility_id`.

### 3.14 Repeat Deviation Formulas

```
total_deviations  = COUNT(*) FROM deviation per patient_id
overdue_count     = COUNT(deviation_type = 'OVERDUE') per patient_id
missed_count      = COUNT(deviation_type = 'MISSED') per patient_id
affected_protocols = COUNT(DISTINCT protocol_instance.id) per patient_id
affected_steps    = COUNT(DISTINCT deviation.step_instance_id) per patient_id
```

Only patients with `total_deviations >= :minDeviations` (default 3) are included.

## 6. FHIR Resource Types (Event Volume)

The following FHIR resource types are commonly observed in `event_log.data->>'resourceType'` across RHIE and CHW integrations. The Insights Service does not restrict or validate resource types — it groups by whatever values exist in the data.

| Resource Type | Clinical Context | Typical Volume |
|---|---|---|
| `Encounter` | Visit registration, consultations, transfers | High |
| `Observation` | Vital signs, lab results, chief complaints, clinical findings | High |
| `Condition` | Diagnoses (ICD-11) | Medium |
| `MedicationRequest` | Prescriptions (e-Prescription) | Medium |
| `MedicationDispense` | Pharmacy dispensing | Medium |
| `MedicationAdministration` | Medication given to patient | Low–Medium |
| `ServiceRequest` | Lab orders, imaging orders, referrals | Medium |
| `Procedure` | Clinical procedures (ICHI codes) | Low |
| `Immunization` | Vaccinations (NPC codes) | Low–Medium |
| `AllergyIntolerance` | Allergy records | Low |
| `ImagingStudy` | Imaging results (DICOM) | Low |
| `DiagnosticReport` | Lab and imaging reports | Low |
| `Consent` | Patient consent records | Low |

> **Note:** Non-FHIR events (`datacontenttype: application/json`) do not have a `resourceType` field. These will appear as `null` in resource type groupings and should be filtered or grouped separately.
